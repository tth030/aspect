Changed: The 'stress', 'shear stress', and 'strain rate tensor'
visualization postprocessors now output their information in the form
of actual tensors that (with deal.II versions post-9.2) can be
visualized as tensors and not just as individual scalar
components. This also implies that now *all* components of these
tensors, not just the ones on and above the diagonal, are output, even
though these tensors are all symmetric.
