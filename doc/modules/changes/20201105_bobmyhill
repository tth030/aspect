<li> New: ASPECT now includes a CompositeViscoPlastic rheology module.
This rheology is an isostress composite of diffusion, dislocation and
Peierls creep rheologies. The composite viscosity and partial strain rates
are calculated using an internal Newton-Raphson iterative scheme.
For improved stability, the composite rheology is arranged in parallel with a
constant viscosity strain rate limiter and the whole package is then arranged in
series with a constant high viscosity limiter. This ensures that the viscosity
function is continuous, differentiable and bounded. The new rheology can be used
with multiple compositional fields.
