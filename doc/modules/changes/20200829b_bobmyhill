New: The rheology module for Peierls creep now includes a formulation
to compute the exact Peierls viscosity, using an internal Newton-Raphson
iterative scheme. The module now also contains a function to calculate the
strain rate and derivative as a function of stress
for both the exact and approximate formulations.
