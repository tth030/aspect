Changed: The steinberger material model now performs
consistent averaging of material properties when multiple
material lookups are used. Specifically, the density,
thermal expansivity, compressibility and phase volume fractions
are averaged according to volume fractions, the specific heat
is averaged according to mass fractions and the
seismic velocities are Voigt-Reuss-Hill averaged.
