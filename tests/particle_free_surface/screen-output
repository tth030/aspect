TimerOutput objects finalize timed values printed to the
screen by communicating over MPI in their destructors.
Since an exception is currently uncaught, this
synchronization (and subsequent output) will be skipped
to avoid a possible deadlock.

Additional information: 
    Combining particles and a deforming mesh is currently untested and not officially supported. If you disable this assertion make sure you benchmark the particle accuracy, and carefully check for problems related to storing the particle reference coordinates for a deforming mesh.

Aborting!
